First of all, I would like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to complete this Front-end & Design Project. I often use Unsplash in my project, and it is lovely to browse those beautiful pictures.  Recently, I have been focusing on UX research, wireframe, and building prototype using tools like Sketch, Adobe, Marvel, Balsamic, and Invision. I have to admit that the coding took me by surprise. Anyway, I worried because my HTML&CSS is a bit rusty. Previously I use flexbox and hack my way into learning Bootstrap but never use CSS Grid before. 

After sketching a layout on papers and build a hi-fi in Sketch, I spend a few hours watching tutorial on youtube. ( CSS Grid Tutorial by Net Ninja series is quite helpful. ) I never use React before so to meet the deadline I used plain Javascript to build the gallery. 

My design concept inspiration is from Wallpaper* magazine. Good quality images remind me of my photography hobby. I have a few friends look and test  a site on different devices.

In the end, I am glad that I learned this new skill and saw the reason why you are using HTML&CSS to build a prototype. It's sound complicate but it not as hard as I thought beforehand.  

You can find my project at a GitHub repository(https://github.com/nattakarnosborne/nattakarnosborne.github.io). Here is a link to the gallery:
